How to empty a fuel oil tank before converting to natural gas.
==============================================================

I decided to convert to natural gas from heating oil after my calculations showed that  I would save over $ 1000 per year and the cost of the conversion was approximately $ 3000.

This jupyter notebook shows how I calculated the remaining oil in the tank.  One of the main reasons I took on this project is that I had a full tank and not having to refill would bring this years cost much closer to last years cost of over $ 2500 worth of heating oil.  So naturally, I wanted to run the tank dry before doing the conversion.  

The trick in this in in predicting the weather.

The second issue is that the guage on the tank is not very accurate and reads zero before the tank is actually empty.  To remedy this I used a tape measure as a dip stick to measure the depth of fuel in the tank.  The radius of the bottom cylindrical shaped section of the tank was 11 inches.  Using this information and the height of the oil the volume can be determined.
